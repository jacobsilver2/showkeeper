# Showkeeper
An app which allows the user to manage multiple music venues, and create shows for the various venues the user is managing.

# Installation Instructions
This app uses Sinatra, ActiveRecord and Rack. Please use "shotgun" to start a local web server, and navigate to the appropriate web address on your browser to use the app.

# Usage
This app has support for multiple users, and allows a logged-in user to create shows for the music venue they are managing.  Create an account, hit "add show", and add as many bands as you want to the bill.  Shows can then be edited and/or deleted.
